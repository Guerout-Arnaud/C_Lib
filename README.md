# C_Lib
C Library to simplify use multiple things

## Description
This library is composed of multiples mudules that i build when i need them. Each of the module is independent (except if the opposite isn't say in it's part) and has it's own git branch.



# Epitech Students
You are free to use this library as you want. A special branch has been created in which the [Epitech][Epitech_WebSite] [Coding Style][Epitech_WebSite] will be respected. I don't hav time to check new [Coding Style][Epitech_CodingStyle] every years. If you find a norm error, please fix it and send a ``pull request`` or, if you can't figure how to fix it, message me with the **file(s)**, **line(s)**  and **type(s)** of error(s).  

## Disclaimer
Warning. Some modules use standard library functions such as ``malloc`` or ``printf`` make sure these functions are allowed for your project. All functions used in each Module are available in the ``README`` of the module.   
I'm **not** responsible if you get flag for cheat beacause you use this library. You can use it but it will be at your own risks.
